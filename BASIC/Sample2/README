  Sample2 - very simple threads run via BASIC
  
  Threads do very simple IO to screen and to file


  To compile sample :

   jcompile basic_main.b
   jcompile t1.b
   jcompile t2.b
   jcompile t3.b
   jcompile f_t1.b
   jcompile f_t2.b
   
  To run sample, 

   windows - Windows will always look in your current directory for executables and dll's
   
   basic_main

   linux - You must tell linux to look in the current directory for the shared libraries.
   
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./
   ./basic_main

It may take a few CTRL-C (break) to fully get out of this program since you are really running multiple programs via the theads.
